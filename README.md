Project for Boot.dev's 2025 Hackathon

Plan from the start that's bound to change: Go based intrusion detection system.	

You will most likely need to run this as root to have monitoring access to your
network devices in promiscuous mode.

So far, I have the interface up and receiving packets. Output is being logged.
Nothing really interesting is being gathered until I work on the alerting system.
